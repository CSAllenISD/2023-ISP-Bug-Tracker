## What is Our Project
Our project is a planner and bug tracker. It can be used by software developers or anyone looking for a calendar. It will have a card view and a calendar view which will both display the same information in the users preferred mode. We will use nodeJS framework due to its large userbase which allows it to have a verity of useful libraries. Our planner will help people stay organized when dealing with a large number of responsibilities as well as helping communication. This will be excellent for teams where the project lead can edit a calendar and instantly update it on every team member's calendar.
